# TT

TT stands for Timeline Tool. I have developed it during my PhD on Visualising Cultural Data at the [Royal College of Art](http://www.rca.ac.uk) in collaboration with [System Simulation](http://www.ssl.co.uk). Visit [my blog](http://research.kraeutli.com) to find out more about the project. 

TT is a timeline visualisation library specifically aimed at digital collections, though it may be used for other kinds of datasets as well. One of its core feature is a novel diagram format for the time-wise visualisatio of cultural data. The temporal attributes of cultural records are often described using date brackets, defining an earliest and possible date for a particular event (for example, the date of creation). The implemented diagram format exploits this tolerance in temporal descriptions to facilitate a compact layout. In addition, possible skewing effects of comparable formats--such as histograms--are prevented. Once it's published, my thesis will provide more information on this.

## Example
